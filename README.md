## My process

I went with the vanilla way. Even though it took longer but it was worth it. I got to play around with different way doing things.

I followed these steps but still overlapped as time went by.

    Fleshed out the html
    Wrote the styles
    Added interactivity

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Animations
- Intersection Observers

### What I learned

using scoped css custom properties

```css
.a-particular-class {
	/* scoped custom properties */
	--color: var(--default-color);
	color: var(--color);
}

.an-added-class-to-a-particular-class {
	--color: var(--another-color);

	display: block;
}
```

harnessing the power of Intersection Observers for animating when a certain content is in view of the current device

```js
const appearOnScroll = new IntersectionObserver(function (entries, appearOnScroll) {
	entries.forEach((entry) => {
		if (!entry.isIntersecting) return;
		else {
			entry.target.classList.add('appear');
			appearOnScroll.unobserve(entry.target);
		}
	});
}, appearOptions);
```
